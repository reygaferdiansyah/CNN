## Introduction

This project aims to classify endangered bird species using machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites
Briefly describe the purpose and goals of your project for classifying endangered birds.

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Python installed
- TensorFlow or PyTorch installed
- Access to a dataset of endangered birds images

## Dataset

Provide details about the dataset you used, including its source, size, and the classes of endangered birds covered.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture is designed for image classification tasks. Details about the architecture can be found in the `model_architecture.py` file.

## Training

1. **Prepare Dataset:**
    - Organize the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Configure Parameters:**
    - Adjust hyperparameters and configurations in the `config.py` file.

3. **Train the Model:**
    - Run the training script:
      ```bash
      python train.py
      ```
